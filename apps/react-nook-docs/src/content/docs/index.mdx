## Getting started

:::caution
*React Nook* is in early development. If you encounter any issues, or have feature requests, [don't hesitate to file them in the GitHub repository!](https://github.com/iwoplaza/react-nook/issues)
:::

You can use your favorite package manager:

```sh
npm install react-nook
```

Then import:

```ts
import { ... } from 'react-nook';
```

Want to jump straight into action? There are various [bite-sized demos](/react-nook/demos) that showcase
specific scenarios where conditional hooks are helpful, and how to use them. If you want a more detailed walkthrough of the features and mechanisms, then keep reading!

## The problem with React Hooks

React = Composable UI, and with the introduction of hooks, that composability soared to the next level! The promise of reusable behavior across components
is not all sunshine and rainbows though. To achieve their goal, the React team had to impose [certain limitations on hook use, known as the "Rules of Hooks"](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks). This mostly boils down to:
- Only call Hooks at the top level (outside of control-flow)
- Only call Hooks from React functions (components or other hooks)

The latter is reasonable and I don't think anyone is arguing about it, whereas the former can be a pain when working in bigger projects.
When writing custom hooks, we rarely plan around someone wanting to skip the hook's execution based on a condition.

```ts
/**
 * @returns seconds passed since mount
 */
export function useSeconds() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handle = setInterval(() => setValue((prev) => prev + 1), 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(handle);
  });

  return value;
}

function Widget() {
  const seconds = useSeconds();
}
```

Now say we want to count up only when the widget is "active". It's easy enough for this simple use case, but for more complex hooks, a refactor
like this can be quite involved.

```ts {1, 5, 9}
export function useSeconds(active: boolean) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!active) return;

    const handle = setInterval(() => setValue((prev) => prev + 1), 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(handle);
  }, [active]);

  return value;
}

function Widget(props) {
  const seconds = useSeconds(props.active);
}
```

What if we want to reset the count every time it becomes active again? Well then we're out of luck, we have to split the components and mount based
on this condition. **What if we could just use hooks conditionally?**

## An enhancement, not a replacement

Before I explain what <Nooks /> are, I want to emphasize that they're not a replacement for <Hooks />, **they make existing hooks better**.
Don't worry about having to rewrite your existing logic.

:::note[(◦°^°◦ )]{icon="heart"}
You can use *nooks* inside of *hooks*, and *hooks* inside of *nooks*! They're cozy like that.

The library also does not replace the React runtime in any way, nor does it require a build-step to work. [React Nook uses a niche property
of tagged template literals, and is described in more details here.](#how-does-it-work)

{/* ## It's safe to call hooks conditionally in nooks - places where it's safe to call hooks conditionally */}
{/* ## Lay back in the nook, and relax limitations */}
## Nooks love you conditionally

<NNooks /> are places in your codebase where "Rules of Hooks" can finally lay back and relax...

Let's go over the relationship between <Hooks /> and <Nooks />
- <Hooks /> **CANNOT** use other <Hooks /> conditionally (the whole reason we're here)
- <Hooks /> can use <Nooks /> conditionally: `useNook(...)`
- <Nooks /> can use other <Nooks /> conditionally: `mountFoo``(...)`
- <Nooks /> can use <Hooks /> conditionally: `nook(useFoo)`

### Creating nooks
The easiest way to create a <Nook /> is to wrap an existing <Hook />.

```ts
// A regular React hook
function useToggle(initial: boolean) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initial);
  const toggle = useCallback(() => setValue((prev) => !prev), []);

  return [value, toggle] as const;
}

// A nook with the same behavior
const mountToggle = nook(useToggle);
```

If you're just now beginning to write these <Hooks />, you may want to write them as <Nooks /> to begin with!

```ts
const mountToggle = nook((initial: boolean) => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initial);
  const toggle = useCallback(() => setValue((prev) => !prev), []);

  return [value, toggle] as const;
});
```

The convention is to name nooks starting with `mount` instead of `use`, just to visually differentiate <Nooks /> from <Hooks />.

### Using nooks

The <Nooks /> API can seem strange as first, but you get used to it. To use `mountFoo` we append an empty template to it, then call the result:
```ts
mountFoo``(first_arg, second_arg, ...);
```
Compared to the <Hooks /> version:
```ts
useFoo(first_arg, second_arg, ...);
```

This small change allows the library to track based on which expression was called, instead of in which order.
[You can learn more about the technical details below](#how-does-it-work)

#### Inside components or hooks
To use nooks inside regular components or hooks, reach for `useNook`.

```ts
function Component(props) {
  // ...
  const [value, toggle] = useNook(() => {
    // Aahh... all cozy and nice
    if (props.active) {
      return mountToggle``();
    }
    // If not active, return a fallback and a noop
    return ['Inactive', () => {}];
  });
  // ...
}
```

#### Inside other nooks

No additional wrapper is necessary in this case:
```ts
const mountTimer = nook(() => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
  // ...
  return value;
});

const mountTimerWithToggle = nook((initialActive: boolean) => {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(initialActive);
  // Resets each time we toggle active, because the timer gets unmounted
  const time = active ? mountTimer``() : 0;

  const toggle = useCallback(() => setActive((prev) => !prev), []);

  return [time, toggle];
});
```
