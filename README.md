## Getting started

Install using your favorite package manager:

```sh
npm install react-nook
```

Then import it into your project:

```ts
import { nook } from 'react-nook';

// âœ¨ Create conditional nooks from your
// existing library of hooks, no rewrite
// necessary!
const mountMyFeature = nook(useMyFeature);
```

## Documentation
